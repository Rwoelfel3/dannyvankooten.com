            <p>I've been selling software as my main source of income for a little over 5 years now.</p>
            <p>It started out with me being hospitalized in Vietnam. With time on my hands, I built a WordPress plugin that started selling really well right away. (Luckily), I was blissfully unaware of a lot of the challenges that come with selling software.</p>
            <p>I worked from warmer parts of the world for a few years and am now finally settling down in my home country, The Netherlands. At least for a little while.</p>
