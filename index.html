            <p class="no-margin">Hi. I'm Danny, a 27 year old nerd.</p>
            <p>I've been selling software as my main source of income for a little over 5 years now.</p>
            <p>It started out with me being hospitalized in Vietnam and thus having some time on my hands. I built <a href="https://mc4wp.com/">MailChimp for WordPress</a> which is now being used on well over 1 million websites.

            <p>(Luckily), I was blissfully unaware of a lot of the challenges that come with selling software back then.</p>
            <p>A few other products followed while I worked from warmer parts of the world for a few years. These days,  I am settling down in The Netherlands. At least for a little while.</p>
