Earlier today, our [MailChimp for WordPress plugin crossed the 2 million downloads mark](https://mc4wp.com/blog/celebrating-2-million-downloads/) and we're super proud of that.

I remember [announcing the plugin](https://dannyvankooten.com/my-newest-wordpress-plugin-mailchimp-for-wp/) on my blog here and receiving only a handful of responses.

A year later, I wrote about reaching [the first big milestone: 100.000 downloads](https://dannyvankooten.com/100-000-plugin-downloads-6-months-mailchimp-wordpress/).

Then, barely 6 months ago we multiplied that number by 10. That makes [1 million total downloads](https://dannyvankooten.com/one-million-downloads-mailchimp-wordpress/). 

We doubled that number again today.

**2 million downloads**

To say I'm not super proud would make me a liar. 

When I started working on this plugin I was still enrolled in University.  In [the years that followed](https://dannyvankooten.com/2014-year-in-review/), I had an amazing time graduating at [Yoast](https://yoast.com/), [traveling](https://dannyvankooten.com/interview-on-webworktravel/) to various countries and [getting 2 wonderful people on board to help further grow my company](https://dannyvankooten.com/introducing-ibericode/).

If the next two years will only be half as good, I'll be a happy man. 

_Thank you!_
