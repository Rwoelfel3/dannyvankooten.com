<p>Hi, my name is Danny van Kooten.</p>

<p>Without wasting your time, here are the most important things you'll want to know about me.</p>

<h3>Danny..</h3>

<ul>
    <li>.. is a 20-something web developer with a knack for sales, born in The Netherlands.</li>
    <li>.. is the founder of <a href="http://ibericode.com/">ibericode</a>, a small company building products to help other small businesses.</li>
    <li>.. develops and markets <a href="https://mc4wp.com/">MailChimp for WordPress</a>, <a href="https://boxzillaplugin.com/">Boxzilla</a> and several other <a href="/wordpress-plugins/">WordPress plugins</a> totaling <strong>well over 6 million</strong> downloads. My code runs on over half a million sites.</li>
    <li>.. works from his home in The Netherlands or from warmer countries during the winter.</li>
    <li>.. loves open source, most of his work is either MIT or GPL licensed and <a href="https://github.com/dannyvankooten/">available on GitHub</a>.</li>
    <li>.. was interviewed by <a href="http://www.webworktravel.com/interview-with-danny-van-kooten/">WebWorkTravel</a> and <a href="https://nomadlist.com/stories/slow-travel">NomadList</a> on his lifestyle combining travel &amp; work.</li>
    <li>.. does <strong>not</strong> take on job offers or contract work. Nope, nope, nope.</li>
</ul>

<p>That sums it up quite well, I think. :) Hope you enjoy my work! </p>

<p>Oh, by the way. Here is a random video testimonial I received in my inbox. It's quite accurate!</p>
